Added a minimal VS Code extension in `vscode-extension/` that provides the `Vani: Run Agent` command to run `agent.py`.

How to test:

1. In VS Code, open this workspace.
2. Open the `vscode-extension` folder and press F5 to launch an Extension Development Host.
3. Use the command palette and run `Vani: Run Agent`.

Configuration options are under `vaniAgent` in Settings.
